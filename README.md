## Problem Title
Smart Refill Station Locator & Tracker for Clean Drinking Water

## Problem Description
A web-based platform that helps users locate the nearest clean drinking water refill stations using real-time data and geolocation. It also tracks individual water consumption and reduces plastic waste by encouraging users to refill instead of purchasing bottled water. The system displays data on water saved, plastic reduced, and carbon footprint minimized. Integration with local governments or NGOs can help in maintaining updated station data.

## Idea
### 1. Nearest Water Refill Station Locator:
Use geolocation and GPS-based services to help users find clean water refill stations. Include status indicators (open/closed, filtered/unfiltered) and allow users to rate stations for hygiene and accessibility.
### 2. User Water Consumption Tracker:
Let users log their water refills and track monthly/yearly water consumption and estimate plastic bottles saved.
### 3.Educational Pop-ups on Water Waste & Plastic Pollution:
Provide informative insights on how bottled water consumption contributes to environmental damage and health hazards.
### 4.Incentive & Badge System:
Reward users with digital badges and points for using refill stations. Partner with eco-friendly brands to offer discounts or vouchers.
### 5.Analytics Dashboard for Refill Station Operators:
Provide refill station owners or municipalities with dashboards displaying usage frequency, maintenance alerts, and feedback trends.
